# Compare versions
  This report can help you to compare objects in transport requests across different systems. It allows you to analyze whole system landscape simultaneously and provides the information about relative versions. The program has user-friendly interface and it is easy to install, just copy paste the source code. It can be a useful tool for analyzing "hard" transport requests before importing. The program uses SAP Version Management mechanism for all objects in change requests. You can run it on any system (DEV, QAS, PRD), so you don't have to import this program into other systems.
